This application runs on [https://iban-generator.be/](https://iban-generator.be/). It allows you to validate and generate (random) Belgian bank account numbers in International Bank Account Number (IBAN) format.

The repository for the back-end application can be found [here](https://github.com/carlos-ds/iban-node).

## Disclaimer

This app was made for testing purposes only. Generation and validation of an account number are purely based on the logic described on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number).
